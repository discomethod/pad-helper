Click on a color to select it, then click in the orb grid (section A) to change the clicked orb color to your selected color.\r\n\r\n**C**: This is the orb strength input field. For the Heal orb, this should be set to your team's RCV stat, and for the other attributes, this should be set to your team's ATK.\r\n\r\n**D**: This is the damage calculation area. In addition to solving for the best move, `pad-helper` can be used to help you calculate how much damage your combos will do! Remember to fill in the ATK and RCV values of your team, paint the orb grid to the pattern you want to match, then click `Calculate Damage` to see how much damage (or healing) you will do.\r\n\r\n**E**: This is the solve area. After filling in the orb grid based on the configuration you want to solve, just press the solve button! Please be patient, this will take a few seconds depending on your computer. Afterwards, you will see the orb grid below the `Solve` button change to something like this:\r\n\r\n![pad-helper after solving](https://raw.github.com/discomethod/pad-helper/master/img/solver.png)\r\n\r\nThe red numbers inside the orbs indicate the order you should move your orb. Start at the orb marked `1`, then follow the numbers until the end. For the above solution, you should move your finger along this path:\r\n\r\n![pad-helper after solving](https://raw.github.com/discomethod/pad-helper/master/img/solver-path.png)\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy using pad-helper to improve your Puzzle and Dragons experience!
